85% lists - redo with sql


-------
refactoring:
get rid of odata get sqlserver service instead
getlist takes 4 different parameters to process queries
init pool on startup 
lists:
	districts: hard-coded list
	condos: hard-coded list
	-agent -'1797' vs '1867'from db, empty usercodes, fullnames coming in,  like select * from dbo.Agent where fullname = 'Denise Ware' 
	offices: fetching all, need to write filter
	
property:
	search :
		todo: params to sql
		problems: * Ids instead of values. Joints on Sql, districts and condo ids are not in db, postprocessing? 
				  * View is code where is the value
				  * Nulls brake xmlrpcparcer, handle in code vs in sql
				  * Images

			--endtime not date
			--time formated without seconds
			--zip has - on the end
		  	--format date
		    handle no recs <value></value> vs <value><string>
		  
	problems: -- L_Status is number -- use case to convert
	

		
tests - re -factor them with new ram sqlService		



fix:
 address
 mls
 agent
 prices are doubles without dots
check all types match:
	Condo vs Condominimum
	Spaces in PropertyType
	
get status from odata type
